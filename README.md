To run the model:

source env/bin/activate;
pip install -r requirements.txt;

Then, if you wish to run the model, you can run it with:

If `virtualenv` is not installed, you can install it with `pip3 install virtualenv`. If you don't have pip installed, install python here: https://www.python.org/.
