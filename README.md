We are doing a senior project. 


# SETUP:

## Node Server

To run the node server:


```
cd server;

```

TODO

## Model

To run the model:

```
cd model;
virtualenv env;
source env/bin/activate;
pip install -r requirements.txt;
```

Then, you can run whatever script you so desire!

If `virtualenv` is not installed, you can install it with `pip3 install virtualenv`. If you don't have pip installed, install python here: https://www.python.org/.
